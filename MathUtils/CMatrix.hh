/// Circulant matrices
/** A circulant matrix is a square matrix in which each row is a cyclic permutation by one of the previous row, e.g.
 \f$ \left| \begin{array}{ccc} a & b & c \\ c & a & b \\ b & c & a \end{array} \right| \f$.
 These matrices are convolution operators on vectors, thus they commute and are diagonalized by a Fourier transform.
 The CMatrix class transparently handles converting circulant matrices into and out of the
 Fourier basis, allowing for computationally efficient handling of matrix operations
 (multiplication, inversion, etc.) of circulant matrices.
 Note, the internal data representation is the transpose of the matrix as defined above;
 the necessary permutation of component order is automatically applied for vector multiplication.
 The FFTs are performed by the <a href="http://www.fftw.org">FFTW library</a>,
 which pre-calculates plans to expedite FFT'ing specific length data arrays. The CMatrix class keeps a cache of
 the FFTW data needed for each size of CMatrix instantiated (which could become inefficient if a wide variety of
 CMatrix sizes are used in the same code, but is suitable for this application where only one size of CMatrix is used
 for a particular interaction symmetry).*/
